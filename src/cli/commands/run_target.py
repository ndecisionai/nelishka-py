Nelishka CLI — Run Agent
========================

This module implements the `run-agent` command for the Nelishka Interactive CLI.
It simulates the execution of an agent’s workflow and provides visual feedback
through a progress bar using the `rich` library.

The purpose of this command is to represent the process of running a configured
agent — such as a data processor, reasoning engine, or workflow executor —
in a visually engaging way.

Features:
---------
- Displays a styled header with the selected agent name.
- Provides descriptive information about the agent’s execution steps.
- Shows a progress bar that simulates the agent’s task progression.
- Prints a success message upon completion.

Usage:
------
From the Nelishka interactive console:

    λ run <target>/<name>

Or run directly as a Python module:

    $ python -m cli.commands.run_agent

Example Output:
---------------
───────────────────────────── Running Agent: my_agent ─────────────────────────────
The agent my_agent is about to execute its workflow.
It will load data, process features, and run its reasoning steps.

Please wait...
Running my_agent ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:08
my_agent completed successfully!

Dependencies:
-------------
- rich
- time
