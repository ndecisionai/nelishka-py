  Trading intelligence workflow: A multi-agent, high-throughput pipeline that
  ingests real-time market and external data, performs analytical assessments,
  evaluates risk and opportunity potential, and enables trading decisions.
  Each agent specializes in a distinct stage of analysis, risk evaluation,
  and execution orchestration.

nodes:
  - name: data_loader
    type: Agent
    role: DataLoader
    description: >
      Ingests raw financial data from streams, APIs, and data lakes. Normalizes and

    type: Agent
    role: Analyst
    description: >
      Analyzes incoming datasets for sentiment, trends, anomalies, and correlations.
      Utilizes advanced analytical tools to derive insights and forecasts. Outputs
      structured intelligence for further evaluation.

  - name: risk_assessment
