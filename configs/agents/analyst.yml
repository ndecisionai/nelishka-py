  version: 1.0
  description: >

    It gathers data, relevant references, and market information, then uses
    an LLM to generate a consolidated context package containing insights
    for downstream processing.

  logging_level: DEBUG

  tools:
    - name: llm_context_pack
      type: Tool

      description: >
        LLM-based tool that synthesizes incoming data, references, and market
        information into a structured context package. Includes key insights,
        relationships, and source references for reporting, reasoning, or
        downstream agents.

  decision_logic: >
    The analyst agent first collects raw data and relevant references,
    optionally fetching market prices via the market_price tool. It then
    invokes the llm_context_pack tool to generate a consolidated context
    package. Logging at DEBUG level tracks all intermediate steps and outputs.
